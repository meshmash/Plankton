  Plankton is a flexible and efficient library for handling n-gonal meshes.
  Plankton is written in C# and implements the halfedge data structure. The
  structure of the library is loosely based on Rhinocommon's mesh classes and
  was originally created for use within C#/VB scripting components in
  Grasshopper.
